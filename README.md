# feature-driven-development
TEAM WORK: An Agile methodology for developing software, Feature-Driven Development (FDD) is
customer-centric, iterative, and incremental, with the goal of delivering tangible software results
often and efficiently. FDD in Agile encourages status reporting at all levels, which helps to track
progress and results.
FDD allows teams to update the project regularly and identify errors quickly. Plus, clients can be
provided with information and substantial results at any time. FDD is a favorite method among
development teams because it helps reduce two known morale-killers in the development world:
Confusion and rework.
